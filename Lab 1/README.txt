This is Serin Yoon's Lab 1 assignment.

The first shape is a square.
The color of the shape is (0.5, 0.6, 0.5, 1.0).
The coordinates of the shape are (-0.9, -0.9), (-0.9, 0), (-0.1, -0.3), (-0.1, -0.9).
The shape is shown on the canvas using LINE_LOOP.

The second shape is a pentagon.
The color of the shape is (0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0).
The coordinates of the shape are (0, -0.1), (-0.5, 0.3), (-0.3, 0.9), (0.3, 0.9), (0.5, 0.3).
The shape is shown on the canvas using TRIANGLE_FAN.

The third shape is an ellipse.
The color of the shape is (1.0, 0.6, 0.0, 1.0).
The shape is drawn using 400 points that satisfy (0.5 + 0.3 * cosθ, -0.43 + 0.5 * sinθ) when 0 < θ < 2π.
The shape is shown on the canvas using TRIANGLE_FAN.
