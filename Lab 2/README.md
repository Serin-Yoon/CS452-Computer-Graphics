**1. Polygon with more than 4 vertices**

- Using TRIANGLE_FAN, an hourglass-shaped shape was made.
- At first, the shape is located in the center of the canvas and moves to the right at the initial speed while rotating.


**2. Direction change using A, S, D, W**

-  Pressing A moves to the left.
-  Pressing S moves to the bottom.
-  Pressing D moves to the right.
-  Pressing W moves to the top.
-  If the shape was rotating, it continues to rotate.
-  If the shape was not rotating, it continues to not rotate.
-  The speed of movement does not change.

**3. Increasing/Decreasing the speed**

-  Pressing the 'Increase' button increases the speed of movement.
-  Pressing the 'Decrease' button decreases the speed of movement.
-  If the shape was rotating, it continues to rotate.
-  If the shape was not rotating, it continues to not rotate.
-  The direction of movement does not change.


**4. Shape jump using mouse clicks**

- Clicking on a specific location in the canvas moves the shape to that location.
- If the shape was rotating, it continues to rotate.
- If the shape was not rotating, it continues to not rotate.
- The speed and direction of movement does not change.


**5. Start/Stop rotate**

- Pressing the 'Start Rotate' button makes shape to rotate.
- Pressing the 'Stop Rotate' button makes shape to not rotate.
- The speed and direction of movement does not change.
