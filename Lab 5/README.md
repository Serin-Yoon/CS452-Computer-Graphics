**1. Rotation**

- Pressing `X` makes the shape to rotate around x-axis.
- Pressing `Y` makes the shape to rotate around y-axis.
- Pressing `Z` makes the shape to rotate around z-axis.

**2. Translation**

- Pressing `←` makes the shape to go left (along x-axis).
- Pressing `→` makes the shape to go right (along x-axis).
- Pressing `↑` makes the shape to go up (along y-axis).
- Pressing `↓` makes the shape to go down (along y-axis).

**3. Scaling**

- Pressing `D` makes the shape to increase along x-axis.
- Pressing `W` makes the shape to increase along y-axis.

**4. Texture**
- Due to the CORS issue, local server is needed (use IntelliJ)
