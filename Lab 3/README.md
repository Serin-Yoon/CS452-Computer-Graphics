**1. Octahedron**

- Using TRIANGLES, an octahedron was made.
- Each vertex has a different color and each face has an interpolated color.

**2. Rotation around 3 axes using X, Y, Z**

- Pressing `X` makes the shape to rotate around x-axis.
- Pressing `Y` makes the shape to rotate around y-axis.
- Pressing `Z` makes the shape to rotate around z-axis.
- Each rotation rotates by 0.1.

**3. Translation along 2 axes using arrow keys**

- Pressing `←` makes the shape to go left (along x-axis).
- Pressing `→` makes the shape to go right (along x-axis).
- Pressing `↑` makes the shape to go up (along y-axis).
- Pressing `↓` makes the shape to go down (along y-axis).
- Each movement moves by 0.05.

**4. Scaling along 2 axes using D, W**

- Pressing `D` makes the shape to increase along x-axis.
- Pressing `W` makes the shape to increase along y-axis.
- Each scaling increases 1.1 times the previous size.

**5. Matrices**

- Transformations order: Rotate X → Rotate Y → Rotate Z → Translation → Scaling
